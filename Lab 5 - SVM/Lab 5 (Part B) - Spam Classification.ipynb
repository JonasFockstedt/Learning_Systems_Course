    "\n",
    "In this part of the Lab (Part B), you will be using support vector machines to build a spam classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many email services today provide spam filters that are able to classify emails into spam and non-spam email with high accuracy. In this part of the Lab, you will use SVM to build your own spam filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be training a classifier to classify whether a given email $x$ is spam $(y = 1)$ or non-spam $(y = 0)$. In particular, you need to convert each email into a feature-vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. The following parts of the exercise will walk you through how such a feature-vector can be constructed from an email.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset included for this Lab is based on a subset of the [SpamAssassin public dataset](http://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/). For the purpose of this Lab, you will only be using the body of the email (excluding the email headers).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Preprocessing Emails\n",
    "Before starting on a machine learning task, it is usually insightful to take a look at examples from the dataset. The following example shows a sample email that contains a URL, an email address (at the end), numbers, and dollar amounts.\n",
    "\n",

    "> Well, it depends on how many visitors youre expecting. This can be <br />\n",

    "> youre running something big.. <br />\n",
    "> To unsubscribe yourself from this mailing list, send an email to: <br />\n",
    "> groupname-unsubscribe@egroups.com <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "While many emails would contain similar types of entities (e.g., numbers, other URLs, or other email addresses), the specific entities (e.g., the specific URL or specific dollar amount) will be different in almost every email. Therefore, one method often employed in processing emails is to *\"normalize\"* these values, so that all URLs are treated the same, all numbers are treated the same, etc. For example, we could replace each URL in the email with the unique string *\"httpaddr\"* to indicate that a URL was present. This has the effect of letting the spam classifier make a classification decision based on whether any URL was present, rather than whether a specific URL was present. This typically improves the performance of a spam classifier, since spammers often randomize the URLs, and thus the odds of seeing any particular URL again in a new piece of spam is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `processEmail(..)`, we have implemented the following email preprocessing and normalization steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower-casing: The entire email is converted into lower case, so that captialization is ignored (e.g., IndIcaTE is treated the same as Indicate).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stripping HTML: All HTML tags are removed from the emails. Many emails often come with HTML formatting; we remove all the HTML tags, so that only the content remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalizing URLs: All URLs are replaced with the text \"httpaddr\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalizing Email Addresses: All email addresses are replaced with the text \"emailaddr\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalizing Numbers: All numbers are replaced with the text \"number\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalizing Dollars: All dollar signs (\\$) are replaced with the text \"dollar\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removal of non-words: Non-words and punctuation have been removed. All white spaces (tabs, newlines, spaces) have all been trimmed to a single space character.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Word Stemming: Words are reduced to their stemmed form. For example, \"discount\", \"discounts\", \"discounted\" and \"discounting\" are all replaced with \"discount\". Sometimes, the Stemmer actually strips off additional characters from the end, so \"include\", \"includes\", \"included\", and \"including\" are all replaced with \"includ\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of these preprocessing steps on the previous sample email, is shown as follows. While preprocessing has left word fragments and non-words, this form turns out to be much easier to work with for performing feature extraction.\n",

    "### 1.1 Extracting Features from Emails\n",
    "After preprocessing the email, the next step is to implement the feature-extraction that represents the preprocessed email as a feature-vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before implementing the feature-extraction, we first need a vocabulary list of all possible words. For this Lab, we have chosen only the most frequently occuring words as our set of words considered (the vocabulary list). Since words that occur rarely in the training set are only in a few emails, they might cause the model to overfit our training set. The complete vocabulary list is in the file `vocab.txt` (one word per line). Our vocabulary list was selected by choosing all words which occur at least a 100 times in the spam corpus, resulting in a list of 1899 words. In the Python code below, the vocabulary list (of 1899 of words) is already loaded for you in the variable `vocabulary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vocabulary list loaded, we can now represent a preprocessed email as a feature-vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^1899$. The $j^{th}$ element $x_j$ of this feature-vector indicates whether or not the $j^{th}$ vocabulary word is present in the email (1 if the word is present, and 0 if not).\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand this, let's have a simple example. To simplify this example, suppose that out vocabulary list consists in just 8 words as follows: `[\"about\", \"anyon\", \"bitcoin\", \"bank\", \"each\", \"site\", \"where\", \"web\"]`, and that the content of our preprocessed email is just: `\"anyon know how much it cost to host web portal\"`. Then, this email can be represented with the following 8-dimensional feature-vector: `x = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]`. As you can see, the feature $x_j$ for an email corresponds to whether the $j^{th}$ word in the vocabulary list occurs in the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now complete the following Python code to generate a 1899-dimensional feature-vector (data-point) for an email, given the loaded vocabulary list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Note:** In Python, you can check in a fast way if a given string `s` exists in a list of strings `list_strings` by first converting the list of strings to a hash-set `set_strings = set(list_strings)` and then testing if `s in set_strings`. This test has a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(m)$ (where `m = len(list_strings)`)."
